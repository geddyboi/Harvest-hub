        <h2>About Our Farmers</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to working with local farmers to bring you the
          highest quality tubo rice, mangoes, and corn. Our farmers are
          experienced and passionate about their craft, and they use sustainable
          farming practices to produce the best possible crops.
        </p>

        <h2>Rice</h2>
        <p>
          Iloilo, a province in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines,
          is renowned for its picturesque landscapes, rich cultural heritage,
          and, of course, its exquisite rice. Rice cultivation has been a
          mainstay of Iloilo's economy for centuries, and the province is now
          recognized as a major rice producer in the country.
        </p>

        <h2>Tubo</h2>
        <p>
          Our tubo rice is a premium variety of rice that is known for its long,
          slender grains and delicate flavor. It is grown in the fertile Iloilo
          Valley, and it is harvested by hand to ensure its quality.
        </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Mangoes</h2>
        <p>
          Our mangoes are grown in the tropical climate of Iloilo City, and they
          are known for their sweetness and juiciness. We pick our mangoes at
          the peak of ripeness to ensure that they are the best possible flavor.
        </p>

        <h2>Corn</h2>
        <p>
          Our corn is grown in the same fields as our tubo rice, and it is
          harvested by hand to ensure its quality. We use our corn to make a
          variety of products, including cornmeal, tortillas, and chips.
        </p>
