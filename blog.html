            Rice farming in the Philippines is a labor-intensive and often
            backbreaking job. Farmers typically work long hours, from dawn to
            dusk, and they use traditional methods of cultivation, such as
            hand-transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting rice by hand.
            Despite the hard work, rice farming is a way of life for many
            Filipinos, and it has been passed down from generation to
            generation.

            Corn farmers in the Philippines play a crucial role in the country's
            agricultural landscape, contributing significantly to food security
            and the economy. Corn, also known as maize, is the second most
            important staple crop in the Philippines after rice, serving as a
            primary source of nutrition for millions of Filipinos. Corn is also
            a versatile crop with diverse uses, including animal feed,
            industrial processing, and biofuel production.

            The Philippines is one of the world's leading mango producers, and
            the Carabao mango, a native variety, is particularly renowned for
            its sweet and juicy flavor. Mango farming is a labor-intensive
            process that requires careful attention to detail, from planting and
            pruning to pest and disease control. Mango farmers typically work
            long hours in the sun, and the work can be physically demanding.

            Tubo farmers are the people who are responsible for cultivating and
            harvesting sugarcane, a major crop in the Philippines. Sugarcane is
            used to produce sugar, molasses, and ethanol, and it is also a
            source of fiber for a variety of products. There are an estimated
            1.5 million tubo farmers in the Philippines, and they account for
            about 10% of the country's labor force. Tubo farming is a
            labor-intensive process that requires careful attention to detail,
            from planting and harvesting to pest and disease control.
